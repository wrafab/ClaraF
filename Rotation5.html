<h1> What's the rules and limitations for 3D printers in WIC?

 </h1>

 <br>

 <p>
   These 3D printers in WIC are the MakerBot Replicator 5th Gen printers which uses a technique called Fused Deposition Modeling(FDM) to 
   print models. Makerbot Replicators basically print models out by heating plastic filamment to certain temperature which can liquify the 
   plastic. These liquified plastic would then become cool and solidify into the shape as it is extruded. Makerbot printers are different 
   from another printer:Formlabs printer---this printer uses ultraviolet radiation to harden resin in order to print different models.
   Formlabs printer can print things that are more durable compared to the models that printed by Makerbot. However, resin used in Formlabs
   is far more expensive than the plastic filamment and the price of resin limits our ability to use it.

 <h1> Meshmixer!---Print you head on something or someone else :)



 </h1>





 <p>

In class today, we need to scan our head and use Meshmixer to combine our heads on somethings or someones. I download a file from a website 
called "Thinkiverse". You can search this website and find almost every files you want for your 3D models. My file is a small fairy, because
   I decided to put my head on a fairy! My classmate 3D scanned my head and I imported my head into Meshmixer. Then I imported the file of my fairy
   into Meshmixer too. In order to put my head on fairy, I had to cut fairy's head off( so brutal). Then I changed the size of my 3D scanned head
  and fairy's body to the proper size. Last but not least, I combined these two parts together and printed it out!

   <h1>  Model that could not be made subtractively

</h1>

  <p>
In the class today I need to creat a model that needed to be made addictively. I built a model of a traditional chinese tower which is the 
    mimic of a tower in Xi'an China called DaYan tower. This is one of the most famous tower in the Buddhist Temple. It did take me a lot of 
    time to build this model because I need to draw a complex geometic shape then revovled the whole thing. I actually asked for help from my friend to teachm
  me how to build the top part of my tower. Although my tower doesn't looke exactly the same as DaYan tower, but I do like it and I think it ended up to 
    be really well-printed tower
