<h1> Making Your Own Clock!

 </h1>

 <br>

 <p>

In the class today, our goal was to design and make our own clocks by using laser cutter. I designed my clock on Corel Draw first.

 <h1>  Sublimination Dye Transfer



 </h1>



 <p>

Except printing a T-shit, I also needed to use sublimination to transfer the images of a kind of special paper to some objects through the help of heat.

   I chose to customize a pencil pouch. For doing this, I created an image by using CorelDraw (remember you need to mirror the image!).

   Then I printed the image on the special paper which is designed especially for sublimination. After I got my printing image, I cutted it according to

   the size of the surface of my pencil pouch then sticked the cutted paper on the pencil pouch with images face down. Then what I need to do is to put pencil pouch with image 

   into the heat press for 60 second! After I took off the paper, I got a fantastic pencil pouch!
