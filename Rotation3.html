<h1> Print A T-shirt
 </h1>
 <br>
 <p>
In the class today, I learned how to design and make my own T-shirt. The first thing I did was finding a copyright free picture (it's really important. You either design your own 
   image of find a copyright free image). Then I imported the image into "GTX Graphic Lab". After making sure the size and place of the image are proper on the shirt, I used heat press to iron the
   white blank T-shirt for 50 seconds. What I needed to do next is I need to do next is download the file of the T-shirt on a flash drive and pint it! Finally, after my shirt was printed out, I need to 
   iron it again for 60 seconds.

 <h1>  Sublimination Dye Transfer

 </h1>

 <p>
Except printing a T-shit, I also needed to use sublimination to transfer the images of a kind of special paper to some objects through the help of heat.
   I chose to customize a pencil pouch. For doing this, I created an image by using CorelDraw (remember you need to mirror the image!).
   Then I printed the image on the special paper which is designed especially for sublimination. After I got my printing image, I cutted it according to
   the size of the surface of my pencil pouch then sticked the cutted paper on the pencil pouch with images face down. Then what I need to do is to put pencil pouch with image 
   into the heat press for 60 second! After I took off the paper, I got a fantastic pencil pouch!
<br>
<br>
In addition to subliminate a pouch, I also did sublimination on a key chain just for fun. I reapeated the same process and the image perfectly transfered from 
   the paper to the surface of my key chain.

  <h1> UV Printing
 </h1>
In class today, I did UV printing on a wood box. UV Printing is basically a form of digital printing using ultra-violet to dry or cure ink 
  on the surface of stuffs. UV printing is magic, because it print a image that I want on a wood box surface perfectly. The saturation and lightness of the image on the box surface
  are unbelievably good, although the process of doing UV printing is a little bit complicate. I need to use red laser in the UV printer to 
  make sure the hight, width and length of my box. However, after making sure these dimensions, the rest of things are easy to do. I just need print what I want on the box by import the image in the computer!
