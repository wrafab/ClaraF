<h1> Print A T-shirt
 </h1>
 <br>
 <p>
In the class today, I learned how to design and make my own T-shirt. The first thing I did was finding a copyright free picture (it's really important. You either design your own 
   image of find a copyright free image). Then I imported the image into "GTX Graphic Lab". After making sure the size and place of the image are proper on the shirt, I used heat press to iron the
   white blank T-shirt for 50 seconds. What I needed to do next is I need to do next is download the file of the T-shirt on a flash drive and pint it! Finally, after my shirt was printed out, I need to 
   iron it again for 60 seconds.

 <h1>  Sublimination Dye Transfer

 </h1>

 <p>
Except printing a T-shit, I also needed to use sublimination to transfer the images of a kind of special paper to some objects through the help of heat.
   I chose to customize a pencil pouch. For doing this, I created an image by using CorelDraw (remember you need to mirror the image!).
   Then I printed the image on the special paper which is designed especially for sublimination. After I got my printing image, I cutted it according to
   the size of the surface of my pencil pouch then sticked the cutted paper on the pencil pouch with images face down. Then what I need to do is to put pencil pouch with image 
   into the heat press for 60 second! After I took off the paper, I got a fantastic pencil pouch!
