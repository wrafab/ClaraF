  Hi, I am Clara, a junior in Western Reserve Academy. I come from Shenzheng China. I am in cross-country, rifelry and track & Field teams.
  I also attended Model United Nation trips several times and I realy enjoy doing it. 
  I have been in Dance and Choir for my freshman and sophomore year. They all are really interesting courses and bring me so much valuable experience.
   I am a kind of person who likes to try new stuffs everything. As such, this year I choose to take digital fabrication which seems like a really fun course so far.
   Besides trying something new, the other reason that I take digital fabrication is to learn how to use those magical machines to make what I want. 
  I saw many of my friend use 3D printer to print stamps and models. I am really looking forward to learn different new skills in this class!!!
