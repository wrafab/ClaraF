<h1>  Fusion 360 Practice Drawing (choose 6 models out of 50)
 </h1>
 <br>
 <p>
 In the class, we learnt how to use Fusion 360 to do CAD design such as making models. In order to build all of these models, we need to know the 
 hight, depth and wideth of the things we want to make. In addition, we need to use the techniques such as how to sketch, extrude, mirror, holes and copy/move
 to make a 2D sketch become a 3D models. It is a really challenge process, but I really get the sense of satisfaction after I successfully 
 finish making all the models for my project which is choosing 6 models to make out of 50.
 </p>

  <p>
  Making these models for me is a hard thing at the beginning. I was not really familir with how to change models' size or how to extrude. Therefore
   it took me more time to make these models compare to others. However, after I finished these six models as practices, I am more skillful at building models by using Fusion 360.

 <h1>  Challenge: Making a hinge
 </h1>
 <p>
 Another challenge that I need to do is to make a hinge according to a Youtube video. It is complicate to make a hinge. I found a video on Youtube which teaches me how 
  to design a hinge step by step. Bascially the hinge is consisted of two parts which are easy to make. What really chanllege here is how to combine these two parts of hinge to gether 
  and at the same time allow the joint of hinge to move. After I failed for several times, I finally use the function wihch called Joint combined the two parts together. Here is my hinge!
