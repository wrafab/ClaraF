<h1>  Fusion 360 Practice Drawing (choose 6 models out of 50)
 </h1>
 <br>
 <p>
 In the class, we learnt how to use Fusion 360 to do CAD design such as making models. In order to build all of these models, we need to know the 
 hight, depth and wideth of the things we want to make. In addition, we need to use the techniques such as how to sketch, extrude, mirror, holes and copy/move
 to make a 2D sketch become a 3D models. It is a really challenge process, but I really get the sense of satisfaction after I successfully 
 finish making all the models for my project which is choosing 6 models to make out of 50.

 <h1>  Challenge: Making a hinge
 </h1>
 <p>
 Another challenge that I need to do is to make a hinge according to a Youtube video. It is complicate to make a hinge but I enjoy the process of making it.
